j2y(1) --  JSON-YAML converter
==============================

## SYNOPSIS

 curl some/rest/api/url | j2y

## DESCRIPTION

Let's face it. JSON is not human readable in its basic dense format.
But when testing a REST API with curl, that's exactly what you get.
So why not convert it to nice human friendly YAML on the fly?

y2j(1) --  YAML-JSON converter
==============================

## SYNOPSIS

 y2j <foo.yml

## DESCRIPTION

I don't know why would you do that, but it felt natural to write the
counterpart of j2y. I had to use the YAML::Syck parser with ImplicitTyping
to keep numbers unquoted in the emitted JSON.
